# To Do List
Welcome to my React To Do List!

This project was created to help me pick up a new skill in React. The goal of the project is to create a simple to do list application that allows users to add, edit, and delete items from a list.

To run this project, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system. Once you have those dependencies installed, follow these steps:

    1.Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/react-to-do-list.git
    
    2.Navigate to the root directory of the project using cd react-to-do-list

    3.Install the project dependencies by running npm install

    4.Start the development server by running npm start

    5.The application will now be available at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
